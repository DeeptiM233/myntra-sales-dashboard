# myntra-sales-dashboard
task 8
i have used the myntra data set to create this dashboard while analysing all the factors. first i started with cleanig the data and found that many row were null so while paying attention to the details i noticed that the discount offer column has mixed values like percentages and ruppees, so i converted this into a custom column that has all the value in percent making it easy to create kpi and charts rather than having a semi valid data. a clean data helped me build a effective dasboard.
